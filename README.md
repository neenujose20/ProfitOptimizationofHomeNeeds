# Profit optimization of home needs
This project outlines how Home Needs, a small home appliances company based in California, tackled their ordering problem. They sought to optimize their ordering process to ensure they have enough inventory to meet customer demand and maximize profits. Using an integer programming approach, Home Needs conducted a prescriptive analysis to determine the optimal quantity of units to order from their supplier for each category of home appliance. The model considered various factors, constraints, and decision variables to optimize their ordering process. Sensitivity analyses were also conducted to determine how changes in different factors would impact the optimal solution.As a result of the prescriptive analysis, Home Needs was able to maximize their profits by ordering the right quantity of each appliance category. The company was able to make data-driven decisions, improve their ordering process, and achieve their goal of optimizing their profit. The analysis allowed Home Needs to make informed decisions and adjust their strategy accordingly to achieve their goals.

The proposed solution to optimize the number of order quantity of home appliances involves using pure integer linear programming, which can be facilitated by Excel's Solver. We will use the simplex method to perform optimization.
The first step in this process is to gather and analyze data from the previous year's sales to determine the demand for each category of home appliances. This data will help us to determine the projected increase in demand across all categories of home appliances.
Next, we will use the information on the available budget and warehouse capacity to determine the maximum number of units of each category of home appliances that can be ordered. This will help us to establish the constraints for the optimization problem.
We will then formulate the optimization problem as a pure integer linear programming problem. The objective function will be to maximize profit, which will be determined by subtracting the total cost per unit from the total revenue generated per unit. The decision variables will be the number of units of each category of home appliances to order.
Using Excel's Solver, we will use the simplex method to solve the optimization problem and determine the optimal number of units of each category of home appliances to order. This will be the number of units that maximizes profit while taking into account the constraints of the available budget and warehouse capacity.

Once we have determined the optimal number of units of each category of home appliances to order, we can place the order with the supplier. This will ensure that the company meets the projected increase in demand while avoiding excess inventory at the end of the year.
Overall, the use of pure integer linear programming with Excel's Solver and the simplex method will provide an efficient and effective solution to the optimization problem of determining the right number of units of home appliances to order.
